# Thanos

## Linux

```bash
path /ThanosLocal.sh # The Path is current dir
./ThanosRoot.sh
```

ThanosLocal.sh is only delete the files of current directory;

ThanosRoot.sh will delete all files except permission deny;



## Win

```bash
python Thanos.py
or 
click .exe
```

If you want to delete C:/ ,maybe permission deny most of files, so you would have done nothing.
